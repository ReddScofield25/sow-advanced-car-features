# Practicing Scope of Work (SOW) Development  
*Imaginary Project: Impact of Advanced Car Features on Price*

## üìä Project Overview  
As part of my Google Data Analytics Certificate program, I was asked to design an **imaginary project** and develop a Scope of Work (SOW) for it.  

I chose to explore, using Exploratory Data Analysis to investigate, how advanced vehicle features ‚Äî such as Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), lane assist, navigation system, blind spot monitoring, heated seats, remote start, and sunroof ‚Äî might influence the pricing of vehicles.  

The purpose of this project was not to deliver business results, but to gain hands-on practice in writing an SOW: a key tool analysts use to ensure alignment, clarity, and accountability across a project.

### Tools  
- **Google Docs** ‚Üí drafted and completed the Scope of Work  
- **GitHub** ‚Üí used to host and showcase the final SOW document

## ‚úÖ Key Learning Outcomes  
- Practiced structured thinking through developing an industry-standard **SOW**.  
- Understood how a well-written SOW minimizes miscommunication and rework by serving as a shared reference for all stakeholders  - Outlined project scope, deliverables, timelines, and milestones in a professional format.  
- Strengthened skills in formalizing requirements and planning an analytics project.  
- Applied EDA principles to explore hypothetical relationships between vehicle features and pricing

## üîó About This Project  
This self-designed, imaginary project was created exclusively to practice SOW development. The emphasis was on learning how to document a project clearly‚Äîso that analysts, engineers, managers, and stakeholders can operate with a shared understanding and execute effectively.
